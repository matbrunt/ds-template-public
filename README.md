A cookiecutter template to create a templated Data Science environment.

New features will be added as we go, initially the template will create a folder structure with helper files for performing exploratory analysis.

Where possible all environments are run within Docker containers, to allow for use across multiple platforms, and easier deployment.

To get started, clone this repo locally, then run `cookiecutter ./ds-template-public`.  

Build Docker image tagged as `matbrunt/analysis`. You can get the build command and latest image version from `CHANGELOG.md`.
